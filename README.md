ESP32 features 10 capacitive touch GPIOs (pins: 2, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 27, 32, 33). These pins can act as touch sensors when connected to a wire. Touching the free end of the wire triggers the sensing effect.

This document provides:

- A simple code example to visualize the touch sensing effect.

- An example that uses this feature to control a LED, lighting it up or turning it off based on touch input.
